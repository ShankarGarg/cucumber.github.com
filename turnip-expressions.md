Turnip Expressions is a more human-friendly alternative to [Regular Expressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression).
They were first introduced by Jonas Nicklas in the [turnip](https://github.com/jnicklas/turnip) tool.

Cucumber (soon) supports Turnip Expressions in [Step Definitions](/step-definitions.html). This document is both an introduction
to Turnip Expressions and a specification to be used by implementors of Turnip Expressions in various programming languages.

TODO: Add examples from the turnip/behat docs and tests.
